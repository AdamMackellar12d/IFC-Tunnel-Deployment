## Review

**The check is failing. Where is the report?**

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59165496/214881281-2f428c31-2de1-48f3-8564-2a7b27fe4174.png "In the Action tab, click on *Summary*.")

**I get the following message in review**

- *lftm*

Looks fine to me. This means the reviewer did not spot any obvious mistakes.

- *The file has a lot more content than required - this approval only covers the concepts as part of Sprint x.y. It may be that the file will fail future checks and will need amendment.*

The file exceeds the requirements from Sprint x.y. While the submitted file has been approved, this does not constitute any approval for content outside the Sprint x.y's scope.
